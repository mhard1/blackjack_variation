This project is a simple game that is a variation of the game blackjack.

The idea was taken from the user "Erich" on beginner projects for python on reddit. All credit for the game idea goes to him.

further information for this project can be viewed at: https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/19ot36/project_a_variation_of_21/

The rules of the game can be viewed once you open the file, in the instructions.

Basically, you are trying to get as close to 21 as possible every round, without busting.
You have 5 rounds to achieve your best score, and you will get a grade based on your score.

This game runs in python, and I recommend you use Pycharm to run it. Make sure you get the community edition.

You can Download and install pycharm at with this link: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?gclid=Cj0KEQiA56_FBRDYpqGa2p_e1MgBEiQAVEZ6--UZKdENJmP8FsVhqolMnUAFkrkzLLT0X-7U3PwCiXcaAnuO8P8HAQ&gclsrc=aw.ds.ds&dclid=CMT_jKm5odICFQoovQod-IQIow#section=linux
